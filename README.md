# Detection-Engineering-Portfolio

Welcome to my Detection Engineering GitHub Portfolio!

This repository is a living collection of practical projects showcasing my skills in log analysis, SIEM engineering, detection writing, threat hunting, and detection-as-code principles.

My goal is to transition into a Detection Engineer / SIEM Engineer role by EOY. I am building this portfolio to demonstrate real-world, hands-on expertise beyond certifications or theory.
